with access to timely cancer-related services a concern. For breast cancer, early detection and treatment is key to 
improved survival and longer-term quality of life. Health services generally have been strained and in many 
settings with population breast mammography screening, efforts to diagnose and treat breast cancers earlier have 
been paused or have had reduced capacity. The resulting delays to diagnosis and treatment may lead to more 
intensive treatment requirements and, potentially, increased mortality. Modelled evaluations can support responses to the pandemic by estimating short- and long-term outcomes for various scenarios. Multiple calibrated 
and validated models exist for breast cancer screening, and some have been applied in 2020 to estimate the 
impact of breast screening disruptions and compare options for recovery, in a range of international settings. On 
behalf of the Covid and Cancer Modelling Consortium (CCGMC) Working Group 2 (Breast Cancer), we summarize and provide examples of such in a range of settings internationally, and propose priorities for future 
modelling exercises. International expert collaborations from the CCGMC Working Group 2 (Breast Cancer) will 
conduct analyses and modelling studies needed to inform key stakeholders recovery efforts in order to mitigate 
the impact of the pandemic on early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.",Cancer,"Access to timely cancer-related services is a concern, and early detection and treatment is key to improved survival.

We performed molecular clustering using data on chromosome-arm-level aneuploidy, DNA hypermethylation, mRNA, and miRNA expression levels and reverse-phase protein arrays, of which all, except for aneuploidy, revealed clustering primarily organized by histology, tissue type, or anatomic origin. The influence of cell type was evident in DNA-methylation-based clustering, even after excluding sites with known preexisting tissue-type-specific methylation. Integrative clustering further emphasized the dominant role of cell-of-origin patterns. Molecular similarities among histologically or anatomically related cancer types provide a basis for focused pan-cancer analyses, such as pan-gastrointestinal, pan-gynecological, pan-kidney, and pan-squamous cancers, and those related by stemness features, which in turn may inform strategies for future therapeutic development.",Cancer,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consists of approximately 10,000 specimens and representing 33 types of cancer.

The Dutch Lung Cancer Audit: Nationwide quality of care evaluation of lung cancer patients,"R.K. Ismail a,b,d, *, F.M.N.H. Schramel c , M. van Dartel d , D.L. Hilarius e , A. de Boer b,d , M.W.J. M. Wouters a,1 , H.J.M. Smit","Objectives: This study describes the initiation of the Dutch Lung Cancer Audit for Lung Oncology (DLCA-L) and reports the first results of three years of clinical auditing. Methods: The initiation, dataset, and data quality of the DLCA-L are described. For the analyses, all patients registered from 2017 to 2019 were included. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the first outcomes of the DLCA-L, including results from quality indicators, patient- and tumor characteristics, and the real-world use of immunotherapy. Results: The DLCA-L was initiated after the surgery and radiotherapy audit for lung cancer. In total, 33.788 NSCLC patients and 4.293 SCLC patients were registered in the DLCA-L from 2017 to 2019. Seventy-three (97 %) Dutch hospitals participated in the DLCA-L in 2019. The registry became nation-wide in 2020. The data quality improved over the years, with complete cases in 90 % of the NSCLC patients. In total, 15 quality indicators were established based on DLCA-L data to improve processes and clinical outcomes. An example of these quality indicators was brain imaging at diagnosis of stage III NSCLC patients, which increased from 80 % in 2017 to 90 % in 2019 and hospital variation was reduced. The DLCA-L provided data on immunotherapy use in stage IV NSCLC (n = 4.415) patients. These patients had a median age of 67 years and 11 % of the patients had an ECOG PS ≥ 2. The number of patients treated with immunotherapy in different hospitals varied between 2 patients to 163 patients per hospital. Conclusion: The DLCA-L has become a valuable and complete data source with national coverage in 2020. A high number of registered patients and limited missing data resulted in better insights into hospital processes and outcomes of lung cancer care. Quality indicators were, with success, used to establish improvements and minimize hospital variation.

We employed a research-purpose population-based citizen panel to assess how often people recall gynecologic cancers compared to other cancer types and to explore the relative importance of different information channels in relaying cancer information. Study design: We conducted an online survey using the Norwegian Citizen Panel (n = 1441 respondents), exploring associations between demographic factors and frequency of mentioning specific cancer types. We also searched The Norwegian Media Archive to assess the media coverage of different cancer types. Factors affecting likelihood of mentioning different cancers were assessed by multivariate regression. Results: Only 41 % of respondents listed one or more cancers in female genital organs. Of the gynecological cancers, cervical cancer was most frequently mentioned (28 %), followed by ovarian (12 %) and endometrial cancer (11 %). Female responders were more likely to mention cervical (OR 2.47, 95 % CI 2.16– 2.78) and ovarian cancer (OR 2.09, 95 % CI 1.60–2.58) than male responders, but not endometrial cancer. Family and friends who have had cancer (50 %) and different types of media coverage (41 %) were reported as the most common sources of cancer information. The three most frequently mentioned cancer types in our survey were breast (77 %), hematologic (76 %) and lung cancer (75 %), which also were the cancer types having most media coverage. Conclusions: Gynecological cancers are less frequently mentioned by Norwegian citizens when compared to several other cancer types such as breast-, hematologic- and lung cancer.

Several molecular classifications have been proposed, but the diversity of their subtype sets impedes their clinical application. Objective: To achieve an international consensus on MIBC molecular subtypes that reconciles the published classification schemes. Design, setting, and participants: We used 1750 MIBC transcriptomic profiles from 16 published datasets and two additional cohorts. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We performed a network-based analysis of six independent MIBC classification systems to identify a consensus set of molecular classes. Association with survival was assessed using multivariable Cox models. Results and limitations: We report the results of an international effort to reach a consensus on MIBC molecular subtypes. We identified a consensus set of six molecular classes: luminal papillary (24%), luminal nonspecified (8%), luminal unstable (15%), stroma-rich (15%), basal/squamous (35%), and neuroendocrine-like (3%). These consensus classes differ regarding underlying oncogenic mechanisms, infiltration by immune and stromal cells, and histological and clinical characteristics, including outcomes. We provide a single-sample classifier that assigns a consensus class label to a tumor sample’s transcriptome. Limitations of the work are retrospective clinical data collection and a lack of complete information regarding patient treatment. Conclusions: This consensus system offers a robust framework that will enable testing and validation of predictive biomarkers in future prospective clinical trials. Patient summary: Bladder cancers are heterogeneous at the molecular level, and scientists have proposed several classifications into sets of molecular classes. While these classifications may be useful to stratify patients for prognosis or response to treatment, a consensus classification would facilitate the clinical use of molecular classes. Conducted by multidisciplinary expert teams in the field, this study proposes such a consensus and provides a tool for applying the consensus classification in the clinical setting.",Cancer,"Bladder cancer is a molecularly diverse disease with heterogeneous clinical outcomes.

A Healthy Lifestyle in Men at Increased Genetic Risk for Prostate Cancer,,"Background: Prostate cancer is the most heritable cancer. There is a need to identify possible modifiable factors for men at an increased risk of prostate cancer due to genetic factors. Objective: To examine whether men at an increased genetic risk of prostate cancer can offset their risk of disease or disease progression by adhering to a healthy lifestyle. Design, setting, and participants: We prospectively followed 12 411 genotyped men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1993–2019) and the Physicians’ Health Study (1983–2010). Genetic risk of prostate cancer was quantified using a polygenic risk score (PRS). A healthy lifestyle was defined by healthy weight, vigorous physical activity, not smoking, and a healthy diet. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Overall and lethal prostate cancer events (metastatic disease/prostate cancer–specific death) were analyzed using timeto-event analyses estimating hazard ratios (HRs) and lifetime risks. Results and limitations: During 27 yr of follow-up, 3005 overall prostate cancer and 435 lethal prostate cancer events were observed. The PRS enabled risk stratification not only for overall prostate cancer, but also for lethal disease with a four-fold difference between men in the highest and lowest quartiles (HR, 4.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.16– 5.89). Among men in the highest PRS quartile, adhering to a healthy lifestyle was associated with a decreased rate of lethal prostate cancer (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36–0.86",Cancer,"There is a need to identify possible modifiable factors for men at an increased risk of prostate cancer due to genetic factors.

Cooperation between chemotherapy and immunotherapy in gastroesophageal cancers,"Maria Davern, Joanne Lysaght *","Gastroesophageal cancers (GOCs) represent some of the most common cancers globally and are linked with poor survival rates. The current standard of care includes multimodal chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. However, up to two-thirds of patients fail to derive benefit from these treatments, underscoring the urgent need to develop better, rationally-designed treatment strategies to enhance survival rates. Certain immunogenic chemotherapies can stimulate anti-tumour immune responses in GOC patients; therefore, combining immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with chemotherapy to prevent immune exhaustion is an attractive putative therapeutic strategy. Emerging studies demonstrate that immune checkpoint-intrinsic signalling in cancer cells supports several cancer hallmarks in addition to immune evasion, including proliferation, metastasis, glycolysis, DNA repair and chemoresistance. Combining ICIs with chemotherapy may therefore potentially enhance chemosensitivity and suppress a range of immune-dependent and -independent tumourigenic processes in GOCs. This review summarises the current clinical trials investigating the efficacy of ICIs in GOCs. The immunogenic effects of chemotherapies and their effects on immune checkpoint expression is discussed, as is the important and emerging study of novel immune-independent functions of immune checkpoints in cancer.",Cancer,Gastroesophageal cancers (GOCs) represent some of the most common cancers globally and are linked with poor survival rates.

Computer-Aided Breast Cancer Detection Using Mammograms: A Review,"Karthikeyan Ganesan, U. Rajendra Acharya, Chua Kuang Chua, Lim Choo Min, K. Thomas Abraham, Kwan-Hoong Ng","The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends women aged 40 and above to have a mammogram every year and calls it a gold standard for breast cancer detection. Early detection of breast cancer can improve survival rates to a great extent. Inter-observer and intra-observer errors occur frequently in analysis of medical images, given the high variability between interpretations of different radiologists. Also, the sensitivity of mammographic screening varies with image quality and expertise of the radiologist. So, there is no golden standard for the screening process. To offset this variability and to standardize the diagnostic procedures, efforts are being made to develop automated techniques for diagnosis and grading of breast cancer images. A few papers have documented the general trend of computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer, making a broad study of the several techniques involved. But, there is no definitive documentation focusing on the mathematical techniques used in breast cancer detection. This review aims at providing an overview about recent advances and developments in the field of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) of breast cancer using mammograms, specifically focusing on the mathematical aspects of the same, aiming to act as a mathematical primer for intermediates and experts in the field.",Cancer,"The American Cancer Society recommends women aged 40 and above to have a mammogram every year.

Understanding chronic Covid-19,Thomas Milovac,"In their timely study, Hampshire and colleagues show that chronic Covid-19 negatively effects cognitive ability, likening the decrease in ability to the age-related decline in cognition between 50 and 70 years of age.1 However, additional information on participant characteristics and severity of medical treatments may help with contextualising the study results. For instance, approximately 59% of participants were female, and according to Townsend and colleagues2 chronic fatigue following Covid-19 infection is more prevalent in females. Consequently, this may mean that cognitive decline may also be more prevalent in females or that cognitive decline may result from long-term fatigue following infection. Furthermore, about 35% of study participants were mechanically ventilated (MV) and this increases the risk of associated health concerns, especially in patients with comorbidities.3 Ibrahim and colleagues4 found a prevalence of complications from invasive MV in Covid-19 patients, and that the risk of complications increased when patients had existing health concerns such as obesity, hypertension, chronic renal or cardiac disease. Additionally, MV in animal studies has shown a propensity toward inducing neuroinflammation, neuronal damage, and cognitive impairment, all of which presumably may extinguish cognitive abilities.5 Therefore, the cognitive decline observed by Hampshire and colleagues may have been due to participant characteristics and/or be iatrogenic and a causal association of Covid-19 with the observed decline requires more thorough investigation into these, and potentially other, confounding variables",Covid,"Chronic exposure to the drug Covid-19 has been shown by Hampshire and colleagues to have an adverse effect on cognitive ability in patients with a range of comorbidities, including obesity, hypertension, chronic renal or cardiac disease and those who are mechanically ventilated.",2018

Inf-Net: Automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation From CT Images,"Deng-Ping Fan, Tao Zhou, Ge-Peng Ji, Yi Zhou, Geng Chen, Huazhu Fu, Jianbing Shen, Ling Shao","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread globally in early 2020, causing the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network ( Inf-Net ) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net , a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.",Covid,"Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices.

Medical imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delineation of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis.

A Weakly-Supervised Framework for COVID-19 Classification and Lesion Localization From Chest CT,"Xinggang Wang, Xianbo Deng, Qing Fu, Qiang Zhou, Jiapei Feng, Hui Ma, Wenyu Liu, Chuansheng Zheng","Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected cases plays a crucial role in timely quarantine and medical treatment. Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning framework was developed using 3D CT volumes for COVID-19 classification and lesion localization. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious; the COVID-19 lesions are localized by combining the activation regions in the classification network and the unsupervised connected components. 499 CT volumes were used for training and 131 CT volumes were used for testing. Our algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability and discover lesion regions in chest CT without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

Analysis and Prediction of COVID-19 Pandemic in India,"Narayana Darapaneni, Praphul Jain, Rohit Khattar, Manish Chawla, Rijy Vaish, Anwesh Reddy Paduri","In this paper, we have analysed the COVID-19 progression in India and the three most affected Indian states (viz. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh) as of 29-Aug-20 and developed a prediction model to forecast the behaviour of COVID-19 spread in the future months. We used time series data for India and applied the Susceptible-Infective-Removed (SIR) model and the FbProphet model to predict the peak infectives and peak infective date for India and the three most affected states. In this paper, we further performed the comparative analysis of the prediction results from SIR and FbProphet models. From this study, we concluded that with the assumption that a total 5% of India's population might be infected by the pandemic, the countrywide spread is forecasted to reach its peak by the end of Nov-20.

COVID-19 Detection Using Deep Learning Methods,"Mehmet Sevi, İlhan AYDIN","According to the world health organization, the coronavirus epidemic threatens the world's health system every day. Health resources in most countries are either insufficient or not fairly shared. There are various problems such as the number of health personnel, the number of beds, or the number of intensive care units. Using limited resources at the optimum level is the key to the country's health systems to overcome this epidemic. Disease detection is an important factor in preventing the epidemic. The higher the success, the more controlled the spread of the virus. Whether the person has a virus or not is usually done by the PCR test. In addition to the PCR method, chest x-ray images can be classified with deep learning methods. Deep learning methods have become popular in academic studies by processing multi-layered images in one go and by defining manually entered parameters in machine learning. This popularity reflected positively on limited health datasets. In this study, it was aimed to detect the disease of people whose x-rays were taken for suspected COVID-19. In such COVID-19 studies, a binary classification has generally been made. The data set includes chest x-rays of patients with COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and healthy patients. Before the classification process, the data augmentation method was applied to the data set.

Neurotrophins and depression,C. Anthony Altar,"Exogenous delivery of the neurotrophic factors, brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), promotes the function, sprouting and regrowth of 5-HT-containing neurones in the brains of adult rats. Similar infusions of BDNF into the dorsal raphe nucleus produce an antidepressant effect, as evaluated by several ‘learned helplessness’ paradigms. Environmental stressors such as immobilization induce depression and decrease BDNF mRNA. Antidepressants increase BDNF mRNA in the brain, via 5-HT2A and b-adrenoceptor subtypes and prevent the stress-induced decreases in BDNF mRNA. In this article, Tony Altar discusses how existing treatments of depression might work by increasing endogenous brain levels of BDNF or NT-3, which in turn could promote monoamine-containing neurone growth and function.

Depression in women,Rudolf E. NobleT,"Depression is the leading cause of disease-related disability in women. Epidemiological studies have shown that the lifetime prevalence of a major depressive disorder in women (21.3%) is almost twice that in men (12.7%). This ratio has been documented in different countries and ethnic groups. Sex differences relating to depression vary with age, with male and female children showing similar incidence rates. National comorbidity data reveal that sex differences in prevalence first appear around the age of 10 years and persist until midlife, after which they disappear. Therefore, women have the greatest risk for developing depressive disorders during their child-bearing years. Several biological processes are thought to be involved in the predisposition of women to depression, including genetically determined vulnerability, hormonal fluctuations related to various aspects of reproductive function, and an undue sensitivity to such hormonal fluctuations in brain systems that mediate depressive states. Psychosocial events such as role-stress, victimization, sex-specific socialization, internalization coping style, and disadvantaged social status have all been considered to be contributors to the increased vulnerability of women to depression. Women are more susceptible than men to stress-induced depression and to changes in photoperiod (more than 80% of individuals with seasonal affective disorder are women). Depression in women may develop during different phases of the reproductive cycle (premenstrual dysphoric disorder, depression during pregnancy, postpartum depressive conditions, and menopausal depression). Other reproductive events such as infertility, miscarriage, oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement treatment have been reported to cause depression in women.",Depression,"Lifetime prevalence of a major depressive disorder in women is almost twice that in men.

Dynamic Multimodal Measurement of Depression Severity Using Deep Autoencoding,"Hamdi Dibeklioğlu, Zakia Hammal, Jeffrey F. Cohn","Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders worldwide, with over 350 million people affected. Current methods to screen for and assess depression depend almost entirely on clinical interviews and self-report scales. While useful, such measures lack objective, systematic, and efficient ways of incorporating behavioral observations that are strong indicators of depression presence and severity. Using dynamics of facial and head movement and vocalization, we trained classifiers to detect three levels of depression severity. Participants were a community sample diagnosed with major depressive disorder. They were recorded in clinical interviews (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, HRSD) at seven-week intervals over a period of 21 weeks. At each interview, they were scored by the HRSD as moderately to severely depressed, mildly depressed, or remitted. Logistic regression classifiers using leave-one-participant-out validation were compared for facial movement, head movement, and vocal prosody individually and in combination. Accuracy of depression severity measurement from facial movement dynamics was higher than that for head movement dynamics, and each was substantially higher than that for vocal prosody. Accuracy using all three modalities combined only marginally exceeded that of face and head combined. These findings suggest that automatic detection of depression severity from behavioral indicators in patients is feasible and that multimodal measures afford the most powerful detection.",Depression,"Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders with over 350 million people affected.

Automatic Assessment of Depression From Speech via a Hierarchical Attention Transfer Network and Attention Autoencoders,"Ziping Zhao, Zhongtian Bao, Zixing Zhang, Jun Deng, Nicholas Cummins, Haishuai Wang, Jianhua Tao, Björn Schuller","Early interventions in mental health conditions such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are critical to improved health outcomes, as they can help reduce the burden of the disease. As the efficient diagnosis of depression severity is therefore highly desirable, the use of behavioural cues such as speech characteristics in diagnosis is attracting increasing interest in the field of quantitative mental health research. However, despite the widespread use of machine learning methods in the depression analysis community, the lack of adequate labelled data has become a bottleneck preventing the broader application of techniques such as deep learning. Accordingly, we herein describe a deep learning approach that combines unsupervised learning, knowledge transfer and hierarchical attention for the task of speech-based depression severity measurement. Our novel approach, a Hierarchical Attention Transfer Network (HATN), uses hierarchical attention autoencoders to learn attention from a source task, followed by speech recognition, and then transfers this knowledge into a depression analysis system. Experiments based on the depression sub-challenge dataset of the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2017 demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. On the test set, our technique outperformed other speech-based systems presented in the literature, achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5.51 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.20 on a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-8 scale [0, 24].

Multimodal Spatiotemporal Representation for Automatic Depression Level Detection,"Mingyue Niu, Jianhua Tao, Bin Liu, Jian Huang, Zheng Lian","Physiological studies have shown that there are some differences in speech and facial activities between depressive and healthy individuals. Based on this fact, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Attention (STA) network and a Multimodal Attention Feature Fusion (MAFF) strategy to obtain the multimodal representation of depression cues for predicting the individual depression level. Specifically, we firstly divide the speech amplitude spectrum/video into fixed-length segments and input these segments into the STA network, which not only integrates the spatial and temporal information through attention mechanism, but also emphasizes the audio/video frames related to depression detection. The audio/video segment-level feature is obtained from the output of the last full connection layer of the STA network. Secondly, this paper employs the eigen evolution pooling method to summarize the changes of each dimension of the audio/video segment-level features to aggregate them into the audio/video level feature. Thirdly, the multimodal representation with modal complementary information is generated using the MAFF and inputs into the support vector regression predictor for estimating depression severity.

Generalized Two-Stage Rank Regression Framework for Depression Score Prediction from Speech,"Nicholas Cummins, Vidhyasaharan Sethu, Julien Epps, James R. Williamson, Thomas F. Quatieri, Jarek Krajewski","This paper introduces a novel speech-based depression score prediction paradigm, the 2-stage ranking prediction framework, and highlights the benefits it brings to depression prediction. Conventional regression approaches aim to discern a single functional relationship between speech features and depression scores, making an implicit assumption about the existence of a single fixed relationship between the features and scores. However, as the relationship between severity of depression and the clinical score may vary over the range of the assessment scale, this style of analysis may not be suited to depression prediction. The proposed framework on the other hand, imposes a series of partitions on the feature space, with each partition corresponding to a distinct predefined range of depression scores, and predicts the score based on measures of membership to each partition. This approach provides additional flexibility by allowing different rankings to be learnt for different depression scores, and relaxes assumptions made by conventional regression approaches. Results demonstrate the framework's suitability for depression score prediction: different 2-stage implementations, based on heterogeneous feature extraction and modelling approaches, produce state-of-the-art results on the AVEC-2013 dataset. It is also demonstrated that, unlike fusion of conventional regression systems, the fusion of two-stage systems consistently improves prediction performance.",Depression,"The proposed framework imposes a series of partitions on the feature space, with each partition corresponding to a distinct predefined range of depression scores.

In view of the high and increasing prevalence of diabetes, we aimed to quantify the burden of type 2 diabetes attributable to PM2·5 originating from ambient and household air pollution. Methods We systematically compiled all relevant cohort and case-control studies assessing the effect of exposure to household and ambient fine particulate matter (PM2·5) air pollution on type 2 diabetes incidence and mortality. We derived an exposure–response curve from the extracted relative risk estimates using the MR-BRT (meta-regression— Bayesian, regularised, trimmed) tool. The estimated curve was linked to ambient and household PM2·5 exposures from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019, and estimates of the attributable burden (population attributable fractions and rates per 100000 population of deaths and disability-adjusted life-years) for 204 countries from 1990 to 2019 were calculated. We also assessed the role of changes in exposure, population size, age, and type 2 diabetes incidence in the observed trend in PM2·5-attributable type 2 diabetes burden. All estimates are presented with 95% uncertainty intervals. Findings In 2019, approximately a fifth of the global burden of type 2 diabetes was attributable to PM2·5 exposure, with an estimated 3·78 (95% uncertainty interval 2·68–4·83) deaths per 100 000 population and 167 (117–223) disabilityadjusted life-years (DALYs) per 100000 population. Approximately 13·4% (9·49–17·5) of deaths and 13·6% (9·73–17·9) of DALYs due to type 2 diabetes were contributed by ambient PM2·5, and 6·50% (4·22–9·53) of deaths and 5·92% (3·81–8·64) of DALYs by household air pollution. High burdens, in terms of numbers as well as rates, were estimated in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. Since 1990, the attributable burden has increased by 50%, driven largely by population growth and ageing. Globally, the impact of reductions in household air pollution was largely offset by increased ambient PM2·5. Interpretation Air pollution is a major risk factor for diabetes. We estimated that about a fifth of the global burden of type 2 diabetes is attributable PM2·5 pollution. Air pollution mitigation therefore might have an essential role in reducing the global disease burden resulting from type 2 diabetes.

This commentary presents the views of the KDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) work group for diabetes in CKD, convened by the National Kidney Foundation to provide an independent expert perspective on the new guideline. The KDOQI work group believes that the KDIGO guideline takes a major step forward in clarifying glycemic targets and use of specific antihyperglycemic agents in diabetes and CKD. The purpose of this commentary is to carry forward the conversation regarding optimization of care for patients with diabetes and CKD. Recent developments for prevention of CKD progression and cardiovascular events in people with diabetes and CKD, particularly related to sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, have filled a longstanding gap in nephrology’s approach to the care of persons with diabetes and CKD. The multifaceted benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors have facilitated interactions between nephrology, cardiology, endocrinology, and primary care, underscoring the need for innovative approaches to multidisciplinary care in these patients. We now have more interventions to slow kidney disease progression and prevent or delay kidney failure in patients with diabetes and kidney disease, but methods to streamline their implementation and overcome barriers in access to care, particularly cost, are essential to ensuring all patients may benefit.",Diabetes,"In October 2020, KDIGO published its first clinical practice guideline directed specifically to the care of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods: We use data from the Look AHEAD clinical trial of behavioral weight loss. Endogenous estradiol and total testosterone levels were determined using stored serum from 996 individuals, mean age 69 years, at two times (averaging 4 years apart) during years 8–18 of follow-up. One to four standardized assessments of attention, executive function, memory, and verbal fluency were collected during this follow-up. Mixed effects models and multiple imputation were used to assess associations that estradiol and total testosterone levels had with body mass index and cognitive function. Results: Estradiol levels were not associated with cognitive function in either sex. Total testosterone levels were not associated with cognitive function in women, but greater total testosterone levels were associated with better verbal fluency in men (p < 0.001), most strongly among those carrying the APOE-e4 allele (interaction p = 0.02).

Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was disseminated via e-mail to 4776 Australian general practitioners listed on the Australasian Medical Publishing Company database. Results: 264 (5%) surveys were returned. 75% indicated that general practitioners were the most appropriate professionals to assess diabetes distress. Sixteen percent reported asking about diabetes distress during type 2 diabetes consultations more than half the time, with 13% using a PROM more than half the time: 64% use the Kessler-10, and 1.9% use the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) scale. While general practitioners had positive beliefs about the consequences of assessing and addressing diabetes distress, they also reported barriers in motivation, environment, and knowledge of guidelines. Conclusion: Most respondents endorsed general practitioners’ role in assessing diabetes distress, but few ask about or assess diabetes distress in routine consultations.

We aimed to evaluate diabetes mortality and trends at ages younger than 25 years globally using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019. Methods We used estimates of GBD 2019 to calculate international diabetes mortality at ages younger than 25 years in 1990 and 2019. Data sources for causes of death were obtained from vital registration systems, verbal autopsies, and other surveillance systems for 1990–2019. We estimated death rates for each location using the GBD Cause of Death Ensemble model. We analysed the association of age-standardised death rates per 100 000 population with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and a measure of universal health coverage (UHC) and described the variability within SDI quintiles. We present estimates with their 95% uncertainty intervals. Findings In 2019, 16 300 (95% uncertainty interval 14 200 to 18 900) global deaths due to diabetes (type 1 and 2 combined) occurred in people younger than 25 years and 73·7% (68·3 to 77·4) were classified as due to type 1 diabetes. The age-standardised death rate was 0·50 (0·44 to 0·58) per 100000 population, and 15 900 (97·5%) of these deaths occurred in low to high-middle SDI countries. The rate was 0·13 (0·12 to 0·14) per 100 000 population in the high SDI quintile, 0·60 (0·51 to 0·70) per 100 000 population in the low-middle SDI quintile, and 0·71 (0·60 to 0·86) per 100 000 population in the low SDI quintile. Within SDI quintiles, we observed large variability in rates across countries, in part explained by the extent of UHC (r²=0·62). From 1990 to 2019, age-standardised death rates decreased globally by 17·0% (–28·4 to –2·9) for all diabetes, and by 21·0% (–33·0 to –5·9) when considering only type 1 diabetes. However, the low SDI quintile had the lowest decline for both all diabetes (–13·6% [–28·4 to 3·4]) and for type 1 diabetes (–13·6% [–29·3 to 8·9]). Interpretation Decreasing diabetes mortality at ages younger than 25 years remains an important challenge, especially in low and low-middle SDI countries. Inadequate diagnosis and treatment of diabetes is likely to be major contributor to these early deaths, highlighting the urgent need to provide better access to insulin and basic diabetes education and care. This mortality metric, derived from readily available and frequently updated GBD data, can help to monitor preventable diabetes-related deaths over time globally, aligned with the UN’s Sustainable Development Targets, and serve as an indicator of the adequacy of basic diabetes care for type 1 and type 2 diabetes across nations.

We aimed to describe the burden of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and that of hyperglycaemia in the Americas from 1990 to 2019. Methods We used estimates from GBD 2019 to evaluate the burden of diabetes in adults aged 20 years or older and high fasting plasma glucose in adults aged 25 years or older in the 39 countries and territories of the six regions in the Americas from 1990 to 2019. The main source to estimate the mortality attributable to diabetes and to chronic kidney disease due to diabetes was vital registration. Mortality due to overall diabetes (ie, diabetes and diabetes due to chronic kidney disease) was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model. Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated as the number of deaths multiplied by standard life expectancy at the age that the death occurred, years lived with disability (YLDs) were estimated based on the prevalence and severity of complications of diabetes. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated as a sum of YLDs and YLLs. We assessed the association of diabetes burden with the level of development of a country (according to the Socio-demographic Index), health-care access and quality (estimated with the Healthcare Access and Quality Index), and diabetes prevalence. We also calculated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of diabetes burden due to each of its risk factors. We report the 95% uncertainty intervals for all estimates. Findings In 2019, an estimated total of 409 000 (95% uncertainty interval 373 000–443 000) adults aged 20 years or older in the Americas died from diabetes, which represented 5·9% of all deaths. Diabetes was responsible for 2266 (1930–2649) crude DALYs per 100 000 adults in the Americas, and high fasting plasma glucose for 4401 DALYs (3685–5265) per 100000 adults, with large variation across regions. DALYs were mostly due to type 2 diabetes and distribution was heterogeneous, being highest in central Latin America and the Caribbean and lowest in high-income North America and southern Latin America. Between 1990 and 2019, age-standardised DALYs due to type 2 diabetes increased 27·4% (22·0–32·5). This increase was particularly high in Andean Latin America and high-income North America. Burden for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes across countries increased with higher diabetes prevalence and decreased with greater Socio-demographic and Healthcare Access and Quality Indices. Main risk factors for the burden were high BMI, with a PAF of 63·2% and dietary risks, with a PAF of 27·5%. The fraction of burden due to disability has increased since 1990 and now represents nearly half of the overall burden in 2019. Interpretation The burden of diabetes in the Americas is large, increasing, heterogeneous, and expanding.

Our study aimed to determine the prevalence of diabetes in patients with schizophrenia and assess their quality of diabetes care. We further aimed to explore the factors affecting diabetes care in patients with schizophrenia. Research design and methods: We conducted a retrospective review of medical records for patients presenting with schizophrenia from October 2017 to October 2018. Thereafter, we conducted semi-structured interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework to explore healthcare providers' attitudes and perspectives toward diabetes care in patients with schizophrenia at a tertiary hospital for mental health services in Saudi Arabia. Results: The prevalence of diabetes in patients with schizophrenia was 3.7%. The rates of annual testing for quality indicators of diabetes were 8.6% for HgbA1c and 31.4% for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Screenings for albuminuria and examinations of the eyes and feet were not conducted. Documentation of smoking status was done infrequently (8.6%). The in-depth interviews uncovered issues with managing diabetes in patients with schizophrenia. We identified four themes: the consequences of poor quality diabetic care provided to patients with schizophrenia; problems with the identification of diabetes in patients with schizophrenia; challenges in the management of patients with both diabetes and schizophrenia; and opportunities to improve the quality of diabetes care provided to patients with schizophrenia. Conclusions: This study identified areas that need a considerable amount of work to be undertaken in Saudi Arabia to help patients with schizophrenia.

"Nutritional risk, not obesity, is associated with mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients","Ana Carolina Palermo dos Santos a , Camila Cremonezi Japur b , Clara Romanholi Passos c , Thereza Cristina Pereira Lunardi c , Wilson Jos´e Lovato d , Georgia ´ das Graças Pena e","Background: Despite the identification of obesity as a risk factor for higher rates of hospital and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and complications due to COVID-19, the association between obesity and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients remains controversial, and the nutritional risk is little considered. Hence, our study sought to evaluate the association between obesity, nutritional risk, and mortality in critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods: Retrospective study were condutcted including adult critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to an ICU between April 2020 and March 2021. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from electronic medical records. Obesity was classified by body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2. A mNUTRIC score of ≥ 5 indicated high nutritional risk. Multiple Cox Regression was used to estimate the association between mNUTRIC, obesity, and mortality. Results: From 71 patients aged 59 (± 15) years, 71.8 % were male. The frequencies of obesity (58.7 %) and death (49.3 %) were high, but obesity was not associated with mortality. Based on mNUTRIC, 85.9 % of patients were at high nutritional risk, presenting a higher frequency of mortality than patients at low nutritional risk (50.8 % vs 40.0 %; p = 0.014). Multiple Cox Regression showed that for each unit increase in mNUTRIC score the probability of death almost doubled, regardless of the presence of obesity (HR = 1.74; p < 0.001). Conclusions: A higher nutritional risk was positively associated with mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients, regardless of obesity, showing the importance of early identification of nutritional risk for appropriate nutritional interventions in this population.",Nutrition,"Obesity has been identified as a risk factor for higher rates of hospital and Intensive Care Unit admissions and complications due to COVID-19.

‘Between foods and medicines’: A qualitative interview study of patient experiences of the meaning and usage of oral nutritional supplements,"Evelina Liljeberg a,b,* , Margaretha Nydahl a , Elin Lovestam ¨ a , Agneta Andersson a","The aim of this study was to deepen the understanding of what oral nutritional supplements mean to patients and how this meaning connects to supplement usage, by exploring patient experiences of such supplements. Qualitative interviews were conducted in June 2019–March 2020 with ten patients with malnutrition or at nutritional risk, prescribed oral nutritional supplements by dietitians. Data were thematically analysed using systematic text condensation. Two final categories were identified: ‘Oral nutritional supplements are a one-dimensional remedy’ and ‘Everyday oral nutritional supplement usage is regulated autonomously’. The patients described the meaning of oral nutritional supplements as nutrition. While the supplements could compensate for nutrients not eaten or be part of a helpful compensation strategy, they could not lessen the burden of altered eating. Supplement usage was described as dependent on the acceptance of taste and the priority given to nutrition in everyday life. Usage was greater when nutrients were perceived as needed, such as when striving for higher bodyweight or disease recovery. Usage was lower when a patient’s own goals were not increased nutrient intake or bodyweight or when other activities were perceived as more important. Patient experiences indicated that oral nutritional supplements could serve as a remedy for malnutrition, but not for a situation of altered eating. Supplement usage was described as being regulated autonomously based on patient views on the importance of nutrition. Those views were diverse, highlighting the importance of supplement prescribers discussing treatment goals with each patient. A deeper understanding of the meaning of oral nutritional supplements and reasons for their usage from a patient perspective is crucial in order for healthcare to provide appropriate, effective nutrition therapy for malnutrition.",Nutrition,"Ten patients with malnutrition or at nutritional risk were prescribed oral nutritional supplements by dietitians. Supplement usage was dependent on the acceptance of taste and the priority given to nutrition in everyday life. Usage was greater when nutrients were perceived as needed, such as when striving for higher bodyweight or disease recovery.",2021

Nutrition support practices across the care continuum in a single centre critical care unit during the first surge of the COVID-19 Q4 pandemic e A comparison of VV-ECMO and non-ECMO patients,"Georgia Hardy a, b , Luigi Camporota b , Danielle E. Bear a, b, *","Background & aims: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are at high nutrition risk. This study aimed to describe the nutrition support practices in a single centre critical care unit during the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. Practices were explored from ICU admission to post-ICU follow-up clinic and patients who received veno-venous extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) were compared to those who did not. Methods: This retrospective observational study included COVID-19 positive, adult ICU patients who were mechanically ventilated for 72 h. Data were collected from ICU admission until the time of postICU clinic. For in-ICU data, results are compared between patients who did and did not receive VV-ECMO. Results: 252 patients were included (VV-ECMO n ¼ 58). Adequate energy and protein was delivered in 193 (76.6%) patients during their ICU admission with no differences between those who did and did not receive VV-ECMO (44 (75.9%) vs. 149 (76.8%)). Parenteral nutrition only being required in 12 (4.8%) patients. Following stepdown to the ward 77 (70%) patients required ongoing enteral nutrition support, and 74 (66.7%) required a texture modified diet or were NBM. Following hospital discharge, nearly a third of ICU survivors (28.4%) were referred for dietetic input. The most common referral reason was loss of weight. Breathlessness and fatigue were the most commonly reported nutrition impact symptoms experienced following hospital discharge. Conclusion: Results show it is possible to reach nutritional adequacy for most patients and that neither VV-ECMO nor proning were barriers to nutritional adequacy. Nutritional issues for patients who were critically ill with COVID-19 persist following stepdown to ward level and into the community and strategies to manage this require further investigation.",Nutrition,Adequate energy and protein was delivered in 193 (76.6%) patients during their ICU admission with no differences between those who did and did not receive VV-ECMO.

Using rich media to promote knowledge on nutrition and health benefits of pecans among young consumers,"Xiao Tong, Amy Szacilo, Hsiangting Chen, Libo Tan, Lingyan Kong","Pecans are a heart-healthy food, serving as an excellent source of unsaturated fatty acids, 3 micronutrients, and phytochemicals. Despite rapid growth of the U.S. pecan export in global 4 market, domestic pecan consumption has been stagnating, especially in attracting young 5 consumers. This study seeks to investigate the effectiveness of the nutrition education brochure 6 that utilizes two information formats- rich media and traditional media- for promoting nutritional 7 knowledge of pecans among young consumers. The experiment followed a between-subjects 2 x 8 2 design. Four versions of digital brochures were developed to manipulate two independent 9 variables: video (absent vs. present) and recipe (absent vs. present). The findings indicated that 10 including a video in the digital brochure can help increase consumers’ perceived information 11 quality, and recipe content can help increase consumers' trust in the nutrition information and 12 information source. The results also showed that for consumers with a lower prior knowledge 13 regarding pecans, educational materials including a video were more effective than materials 14 without a video. Such strategies to promote pecan consumption could benefit the pecan industry 15 as well as public health.",Nutrition,"Pecans are a heart-healthy food, serving as an excellent source of unsaturated fatty acids, 3 micronutrients, and phytochemicals.

Nutritional support in surgical oncology: A survey by SICO in collaboration with the Intersociety Italian Working Group for Nutritional Support in Cancer Patients⋆,"Michele Grieco a,* , Paolo Delrio b , Laura Lorenzon c , Amedea Luciana Agnes d , Riccardo Caccialanza e , Paolo Pedrazzoli f , Gloria Santoro c , Franco Roviello g , Massimo Carlini a","Purpose: Nutritional support is a keystone component in perioperative care in patients undergoing oncological surgery with a direct impact on surgical outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate how nutritional support in the surgical setting is managed and applied in Italian hospitals. Methods: A national survey was designed by the Italian Society of Surgical Oncology (SICO) and disseminated in early 2021. The results were analyzed for the entire population and for comparing the following different subgroups: northern vs. southern regions; high-volume vs. low-volume centers; and junior vs. senior surgeons. Results: Out of the 141 responses collected from all Italian regions, 43.2% of the participants worked in a surgical unit where nutritional status evaluations and interventions were not routinely practiced, although the key features (nutritional counseling, oral supplementation, enteral and parenteral nutrition) were available in 77.3% of the hospitals. Among the participating centers, the ERAS protocol was systematically applied in only 29.5% of cases, and in 25.5% of cases, most of the items were followed, although not systematically. Among the surgeons who practiced in compliance with the ERAS pathways, almost half of the participants declared that the protocol was applied only for low-risk patients. No significant differences were documented when comparing Italian regions, high-volume vs. low-volume institutions or junior vs. senior participants. Conclusion: Nutritional support in oncological surgery is frequently neglected in Italian hospitals, regardless of the geographic distribution and volumes of the institutions. A cultural change and an improvement in the availability of nutritional services are needed for widespread implementation.",Nutrition,"Nutritional support in oncological surgery is frequently neglected in Italian hospitals, regardless of the geographic distribution and volumes of the institutions.

Achievement of nutritional goals after a pediatric intensive care unit nutrition support guideline implementation,"Lalin Rungsattatharm a , Lalida Kongkiattikul b, * , Rujipat Samransamruajkit b , Sirinuch Chomtho","Background and aims: A nutrition support guideline was developed and implemented in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) to improve the nutritional management of patients. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of this guideline on achieving energy and protein delivery goals. Methods: Medical records of the patients admitted in the PICU from August 2015 to April 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who stayed in the PICU for less than 24 h or had an inborn error of metabolism were excluded. Achievement of nutritional goals was compared between the patients during the pre-implementation period (August to October 2015) and post-implementation period (November 2015 to April 2017) of the guideline. Subgroup analysis by protocol compliance was conducted in the post-implementation group. Results: A total of 215 patients were included in the study (53 pre-implementation, 162 postimplementation). There were no differences between the two groups in patient characteristics, time to start enteral nutrition, time to reach the energy delivery goal, time to reach the protein delivery goal, and proportion of the patients who reached each goal. In the post-implementation group, parenteral nutrition was delayed to three days compared with one day in pre-implementation (p ¼ 0.027) and the proportion of patients who did not receive nutrition support was lower (3.1% vs 9.4% preimplementation, p ¼ 0.043). Subgroup analysis in the post-implementation group showed that 69.7% of the patients were protocol compliant, of which the time to reach the energy delivery goal (59 vs 103 h, p < 0.001) and protein delivery goal (64 vs 135 h, p ¼ 0.02) were significantly shorter compared with the non-compliant group. Moreover, the proportion of the patients who reached the energy delivery goal (75.2% vs 24.5%, p < 0.001) and protein delivery goal (56.6% vs 12.2%, p < 0.001) were higher in the compliant group. Conclusions: Compliance with the nutrition support guideline significantly improved the achievements in delivering energy and protein to patients in PICU. Increasing compliance with the guideline may improve clinical outcomes in PICU patients.",Nutrition,A nutrition support guideline was developed and implemented in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) to improve the nutritional management of patients.

Association between Palliative Performance Scale and nutritional aspects in individuals with cancer in exclusive palliative care,"Evelyn Thayse Silveira Palhano Souto Leiros a , Letícia Gabriella Souza da Silva b , Camila de Carvalho Gomes c , Jeane Cristina Alves de Sousa Dantas d , Marcia Marília Gomes Dantas Lopes","Background & aims: Palliative care in incurable cancer should be focused on symptom control, especially those impacting nutrition. This study aims to verify associations between functional performance using the Palliative Performance Scale Version 2 (PPS2) and nutritional and clinical aspects in cancer patients in exclusive palliative care (EPC). Methods: Through a cross-sectional study, twenty-seven patients recently referred to the EPC outpatient clinic were evaluated. PPS2 was used to define functional performance, while nutritional aspects were obtained using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). Fisher's Exact test and correspondence analysis were used with a 5% level of significance. Results: Of 27 eligible patients, a higher frequency of PPS2 levels 50% and 40% (70.3%) was observed, reflecting important functional impairments. The sample was mainly composed of severely malnourished patients (70.4%), polysymptomatic, and in critical need of nutritional intervention (96.3%). Regarding the primary diagnosis, gastrointestinal (37%) and lung (26%) cancer were the most prevalent. No associations between PPS2 and nutritional and clinical aspects were observed; however, the correspondence analysis demonstrated proximity between low PPS2 levels and worse nutritional markers. Conclusions: PG-SGA and PPS2 tools combined are suggested due to their importance in guiding assistance to cancer patients in EPC.",Nutrition,"Palliative care in incurable cancer should be focused on symptom control, especially those impacting nutrition.
